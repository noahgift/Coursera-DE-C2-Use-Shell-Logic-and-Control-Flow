## Goal:   Learn to write loops in Bash

Let's practice writing loops in Bash

### Part 1: Work with a simple for loop in Bash

1.  Run the following command in your Bash terminal:  `./fruitloop.sh`
2.  Add another fruit to the loop by editing the file `fruitloop.sh` in `vim` or Visual Studio Code
3.  How could extend this loop further?

### Part 2: Create ten test files with a Bash Loop

1. Run the the script `./topten.sh`
2. What happened?
3. Change the script to create 11 files.
4. Now write a cleanup script that removes the files using a similar loop
